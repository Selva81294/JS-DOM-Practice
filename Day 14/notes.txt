//DOM Events
console.log(window); ===> to view all events
* Document itself contains inside the window
//Exercise:
create a new div with five para; set attribute for five para(class,"className"); use querySelectorAll to change the text content.
Writa a content in para and append it.

//some propertied in windows:
console.log(window.location.host); =====> used to view the host.
window.location.reload();  =====> used to reload repeatedly.

//alert 
* alert is used to alert the user at particular time 
//prompt
* it is used to ask question to user at required time
//confirm
* it is used for confirmation from user side

//replace
location.replace("which location");
* it used to replace the location to another location

//onclick function
<button onclick="newFunction()">call me</button>
js code:
function newFunction()
    {
    prompt("Please enter ur name:")
    }
* it is used to perform onclick functions. in above instance, when the button is clicked prompt message will appear.



//setTimeout
syntax:
setTimeout(newFunction,time in milliseconds);
Example:
setTimeout(newFunction,5000);

* it is used to set time for the execution of any functions or actions
* here the function will occur once after the give time

//setTimeout & clearTimeout:
Code using both setTimeout & clearTimeout:
let timer = document.createElement("h1");
document.body.append(timer);
let count = 0;
function timeoutFun(){
    count = count+1;
    timer.textContent = count;
    let id = setTimeout(timeoutFun,1000);
    if (count ==10){
        clearTimeout(id);           // clearTimeout is used to stop timeOut
        timer.textContent = "";
    }
}

//setInterval:
syntax same as setTimeout.
Example:
setInterval(newFunction,5000);
* here the function will occur repeatedly at the given time interval.
* in above example; the function will occur at every 5 secs
