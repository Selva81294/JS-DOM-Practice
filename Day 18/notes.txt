Promise
 - What is promise?
    A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation,
    and its resulting value
    - Syntax:
        let promiseName = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            if else condition used here....
        })
    - it is used to showa the resolve or reject status of an asynchronous operation

 - Promise States
    Three States 
        1. Pending
        2. fulfilled
        3. rejected

 - promise methods
    1. promise.then (resolve msg)
    2. promise.catch (reject msg)
    3. promise.all(for multiple promises)
        * promise.all will work when all promises are resolved; if one promise is rejected only
          error msg will through as an output.

  - Promise chain
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Await Sync(important):
     * it is found to avoid promise chaining method
     * here we can achieve aync function easily
2 main rule in Async Function:
     1. async keyword must be placed before calling function
     2. await keyword must be place before which function u want to wait

syntax:
    async function main(){           ====> async keyword must be placed
    const first = await firstCall(); ====> await keyword must be place before which function u want to wait
    console .log(first);
    secondCall();
    thirdCall();
    fourthCall();
}
main();

Error handling Async-await:
syntax:
    try {
        your codes.........
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
    }
